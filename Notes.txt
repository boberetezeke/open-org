Plugins
--------------

Making a new plugin

* from directory above open-org
* rails plugin new engine_name --mountable
* cp template/engine.gemspec to root of newly generated engine and replace
  engine_name with the relevant content

Adding it to the main project

* create github project for plugin
* add it into the gem file like
** gem 'open-org-engine_name', git: 'git:..../open-org-engine_name.git'
* run rake engine:symlink[open-org-engine_name]
* run rake engine_name:install:migrations (where '-'s in engine name are replaced with '_'s)

Plugin naming

* Make sure to not use '-''s in the name as this causes the main project's
  tests to fail

Copying migrations

* rake engine_name:install:migrations

Testing plugins

* Don't know why, but need to use generated dummy project and not open-org
  cloned into test directory as dummy
